                        Born and raised in the Quad Cities, Iowa, Dr. Thomas Adams decided to pursue his career in chiropractic after his own life and health changed dramatically. Once finally turning to chiropractic care, he was able to avoid low back surgery recommendations, get off previously prescribed medications, and really turn his life around. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="cs-text">
                        After graduating from the University of Iowa, He attended Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, IA. He is now excited to bring his chiropractic passion and serve in Kansas City and surrounding communities. He enjoys treating patients of all ages because he believes chiropractic is for everyone in all stages of life, but his true passion is working within the pediatric & prenatal community to help young kiddos develop optimally and naturally. Dr. Adamsâ€™s mission is to create generational change by serving his community in the healing art of chiropractic at the highest level.
                    </p>
                    <p class="cs-text">
                        He is a member of the International Chiropractic Association (ICA), International Chiropractic Pediatric Association (ICPA), and Pediatric Experience (PX). Dr. Thomas Adams is also certified in the Perinatal Webster Technique & specializes in extremity adjusting.

                        Amber is a Chicago native and moved to Kansas City with Dr. Thomas and her two dogs, Kiya & Milo, 3 years ago. Amber attended the University of Iowa for 4 years receiving her undergraduate degree and then shortly after received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing in an accelerated program at Trinity College of Nursing. She has worked on the postpartum floor as well as a private OBGYN clinic as a registered nurse. Amber is currently studying to obtain her IBCLC degree as she is most passionate about natural healthcare for mamas and babies and especially about breastfeeding education and support! In her free time, she most enjoys taking her dogs to the park, going on weekend trips with her family, spending time with friends, crafting with her Cricut, and working out! Amber loves and is passionate about chiropractic because she suffered from vertigo, migraines, and TMJ disorder for many years before being introduced to chiropractic. Since being under chiropractic care, she has realized the power of it and no longer suffers from these issues. Amber canâ€™t wait to serve the KC area with chiropractic and continue building bright futures for generations to come.

                        For your first appointment, weâ€™ll have you fill out some questions about your health history, including the physical, mental, emotional, and chemical stress in your life. Then weâ€™ll sit down for a free consultation explaining what we do and answering any questions or concerns you might have. This is where weâ€™ll determine if youâ€™re a candidate for chiropractic care, and if we can provide the health answers youâ€™re looking for.

                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        Next, weâ€™ll begin your examination. This will consist of a neurological/orthopedic test, spinal x-rays, and a postural analysis. Posture provides a unique window into the nervous system. When your body is compensating for stress on certain nerves, it shows up in your posture.

                        Weâ€™ll discuss the findings of your examination in detail to give you a clear understanding of what we do and how it will benefit your health specifically. Finally, it will be time for your first adjustment! Next, weâ€™ll give you some time to recover in our resting room, followed by a thermographic scan to make sure your adjustment was effective.

                        Itâ€™s important to remember that since each human is unique, we all heal and get stronger at different rates. But when we restore your bodyâ€™s intended functions, with time and repetition, your natural healing processes can start to take place.
