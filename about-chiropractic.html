                <p>
                    Chiropractic care was established in 1895 by Daniel David Palmer and carried into the 20th century by his son, Bartlett Joshua. Their techniques were quickly found to help patients regain hearing, recover from heart and liver conditions, and heal from diabetes. From the little city of Davenport, Iowa, it has since traveled across the globe, with millions of successful case studies reported. Though they were without X-rays and the advanced medical scanning technology of our day, today we know more than ever about why chiropractic works. Technology has only improved the accuracy and effectiveness of our care, so we know when to adjust and when to hold off.

                <h3>Premise of Chiropractic</h3>
               
                <p>
                    Your central nervous system isn’t just a warning apparatus to make sure you don’t lean on a hot stove or go out in the winter without a coat. It’s an entire communications system for your body— an organic internet, controlling every type of cell and tissue in the body. Functions as varied as respiration, digestion, sleep, recovery, and many more are all under the command of your central nervous system. So naturally, when that system experiences unnatural stress and irritation, all these other systems are disrupted, and symptoms begin to appear. Chiropractic care is designed to realign the central nervous system back into its natural functionality, so you can stop treating these satellite symptoms and get to the root of your issues. While adjustment is not always an immediate fix, it does allow the body to begin to repair itself, then move forward with the ongoing wellness it was designed to experience..

                <h2 class="cs-title">Upper Cervical Technique</h2>
                <p class="cs-text">
                   Innate Family Chiropractic (IFC) is dedicated to providing you with specific and scientific care, toward real, measurable results. To meet this goal we use a technique called Knee Chest Upper Cervical Specific Chiropractic. It’s a long name meaning that we focus on the top two bones in the neck. These crucial vertebrae surround and protect the impossibly complex and delicate brainstem, which sends signals to every system in your body, controlling functions and responses such as pain, sleep, digestion, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and more. </p>
                <p class="cs-text">Therefore, careful, specific adjustments to these two key vertebral bones can remove stressed, pinched areas, allowing a greater capacity of nerve signals to flow to your body. You become capable of more of what your body was already designed to do.</p>
                <p class="cs-text">To help gauge the state of your body and nervous system, we use two forms of scientific, empirical testing.</p>
            </div>
            <ul class="cs-card-group">
                <li class="cs-item">

                        <h3 class="cs-h3">X-ray</h3>
                        <p class="cs-item-text">
                            With the naked eye, we can’t see the precise position of those key bones, but that’s where technology comes in. At IFC, we use a comprehensive set of X-ray images to determine each patient’s listing, or the orientation of their vertebrae. This helps us to determine how much adjustment each patient needs to return to proper alignment. We take these images periodically to gauge long-term progress.
                        </p>

                        <p class="cs-item-text">
                        An X-ray for every visit would be too many, however. That’s why, for each visit, we use an infrared thermographer, scanning the body heat signatures emitted from the back of your neck. This gives us an accurate computer graph of the activity and position of the area surrounding your brain stem. Rather than projecting energy, like an X-ray, this device simply reads the infrared energy your body is already projecting, so there is no radiation. Thermography is an FDA-approved neurodiagnostic technique and is in common use in many medical fields.

                        <p class="cs-item-text">
                           After your initial adjustment, it’s essential to let your body rest in an unstressed, relaxed position for a few minutes. That’s why we have a resting room optimized for this exact purpose. In one of our comfortable, zero gravity chairs, your body will begin to adapt to the sudden change brought about by the adjustment, ultimately increasing the procedure’s effectiveness. After a brief rest, we’ll take another thermal scan to make sure your adjustment was accurate.

                    Pregnancy brings a host of remarkable changes to a woman’s body, and while some are obviously visible, some are not. Her spine can increase its curvature, and the added weight of the baby can significantly change her posture and gait, leading to the characteristic “waddle.” But on a microscopic level, hormonal and chemical changes abound, all controlled by the central nervous system. A regular adjustment schedule will help ensure that these changes are happening according to the body’s ingenious design.

                <h3>Child Care</h3>
                <p class="cs-text">
                   It’s in the name. Innate Family Chiropractic believes in promoting health for your entire family, including children of every age. Even infants. Birth is always a stressful process for an infant to experience. With such a delicate nervous system, and such a rapid explosion of growth and development, a proper adjustment as early as possible is key. We believe so strongly in this that we are happy to make a house or hospital call free of charge as a gift to your family. According to the latest research, 95% of children sustain a subluxation during even normal, routine birth. Different from adult adjustment, infant adjustment requires only the gentlest contact. There is no twisting or turning of the spine involved. 
                </p>
                <p class="cs-text">
                    From there, we offer chiropractic care for children along every stage of development. In fact, it’s not uncommon for our office to resemble a group playdate, and your kids will look forward to their visits. 
                </p>

                <p class="cs-text">
                    With childhood chiropractic care, we build a foundation for lifelong health and wellness, so kids can grow up realizing their fullest potential.
